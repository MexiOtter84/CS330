## How do I approach designing software? ##
  I approach designing software now from the perspective of picturing what I would like to end with and not starting there. Like anything in life, you set yourself up for a goal and you think of what it looks like or what you want and then take the steps to get there. The same goes for software development.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? ###
This project has allowed me to work with OpenGL and understanding the concepts of 3D designing. I have never created anything in 3D before, and this is a start of something that I'm going to continue to invest time in for personal projects.

### What design process did you follow for your project work? ###
I followed the Lean UX design process mostly within this project.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? ###
Following the same process that I did previously with picturing what I want to see at the end of the project and remember that we cannot begin there but instead must take steps to get there.

## How do I approach developing programs? ##
I approach developing programs the same way as I do when designing software. I remember that each step in development has to be taken to get to the end goal and if you try to just code and get to a finalized step the first time will only make it harder on yourself. Instead take parts of the program and develop those first and build upon those to get to that end goal. Always test each part of those projects as well.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? ###
I learned Strategic Planning techniques that emphasized heavily on defining goals and objectives within the assigne dproject.

### How did iteration factor into your development? ###
I wanted to be sure to do testing of each item within the 3D scene that was added. I made several changes to the design as I began and ended up where I wanted to be. The original project evolved to what it is at the end of the day.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? ###
I learned how to build each object and realized what is necessary to program and design each object. As I added lighting to the scene, I then learned how to adjust shiniess as well as how light is reflected within the scene.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? ##
I believe that computer science will help me achieve my goals by assiting with helping me learn more about concepts and designs. I do not believe a position in software development is something I plan on being, but I do see the skills and can apply them in any avenue that I decide to proceed with in the future.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? ###
I'm not sure if I'll continue on with a Masters degree but I always wanted to at leaset get there with a long term goal before to get a PhD. This course just opens up more ideas and pathways to a career that I'll enjoy.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? ###
Being able to use OpenGL was very insightful and gives more options and skills to be able to add on my resume. I also am proceeding with creating a videogame as more of a passion project and I was going to leave the 3D development to some associates but I may tinker more around with it to learn more.
